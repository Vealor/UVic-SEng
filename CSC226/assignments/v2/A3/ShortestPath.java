/* ShortestPath.java
   CSC 226 - Fall 2014
   Assignment 3 - Template for Dijkstra's Algorithm
   
   This template includes some testing code to help verify the implementation.
   To interactively provide test inputs, run the program with
	java ShortestPath
	
   To conveniently test the algorithm with a large input, create a text file
   containing one or more test graphs (in the format described below) and run
   the program with
	java ShortestPath file.txt
   where file.txt is replaced by the name of the text file.
   
   The input consists of a series of graphs in the following format:
   
    <number of vertices>
	<adjacency matrix row 1>
	...
	<adjacency matrix row n>
	
   Entry A[i][j] of the adjacency matrix gives the weight of the edge from 
   vertex i to vertex j (if A[i][j] is 0, then the edge does not exist).
   Note that since the graph is undirected, it is assumed that A[i][j]
   is always equal to A[j][i].
	
   An input file can contain an unlimited number of graphs; each will be 
   processed separately.
